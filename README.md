# Project1_CyberScanner
In this project I created a basic site explain a cyber security scanner that users can use online, however he site is not launched on a database, so everything that is stored will be on my local device. A home page welcomes the user. On the home page the user can interact with the CyberBot, this Bot stores certain keywords if the user enters or provides an input that is exaclty like the keyword then an output is displayed by the Bot. 
There are various tabs to navigate to like the "Scan Now" tab, this is where the user can use the AI integrated tool that can scan their files for any malicious activity. 
the AI tool is used to intgerate is VirusTotal, this tool also has it's own site. I just used a Key to which I linked in my program.
